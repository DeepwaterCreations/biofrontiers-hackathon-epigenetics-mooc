# Epigenetics MOOC

Writing assignments in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) don't just provide students with grades: they contain data useful for assessing student learning.

This pipeline analyzes the effectiveness of human learning in a highly abstract scientific domain, epigenetics, and is based on data from the Coursera course “Epigenetic Control of Gene Expression” (https://www.coursera.org/learn/epigenetics) by the University of Melbourne.

This pipeline extracts each student’s answer and associated scores from the HTML data from the coursera website for natural language processing and neural network analysis.
